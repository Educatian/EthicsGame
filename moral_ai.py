"""
Machine Morality: A 3D ethical decision-making game built using Panda3D.

Goal:
Simulate an AI driving a car through a virtual city. The AI encounters moral dilemmas like choosing between two pedestrians or swerving into a wall. Each decision should log the ethical choice and trigger world state changes.

Requirements:
- Basic 3D world with ground, road, and simple car model.
- Player controls a car using arrow keys.
- When a dilemma zone is entered, pause movement and present 2â€“3 choices via on-screen text.
- Log the player's decision and show outcome.
- Ethical evaluation stub (can be expanded later).
